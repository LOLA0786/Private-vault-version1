## 1. Problem
AI systems execute actions without deterministic enforcement.

## 2. Core Thesis
Deterministic enforcement must precede stochastic model output execution.

## 3. Architecture
- Deterministic Policy Engine
- Probabilistic Behavioral Monitor
- Hybrid Decision Layer
- Multi-Tenant Isolation
- Cryptographic Ledger
- Replay Reproducibility

## 4. Threat Model
- Prompt Injection
- Replay Attacks
- Policy Bypass
- Drift Exploitation
- Cross-Tenant Leakage

## 5. Why Deterministic Pre-Execution Matters
Monitoring after execution is too late.

## 6. Wedge
Embed enforcement layer between LLM and tool execution.
